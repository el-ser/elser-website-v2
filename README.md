You found my project! This project aims to showcase my developer skills and experience throughout my entire career. It also contains the blogs that I create from time to time which is hosted in [Hashnode](https://elser.hashnode.dev/). 

I intentionally made this repository public hoping that it would help others in creating their own website. In case you don't know, I started my career as a Software Development Engineer in Test and has now switched to a full time developer. So for those of you who are planning to be Software Developer or Software Engineer, if I can do it so can you!
